# AI-Learning
This repository is my personal active research effort to learn more about AI, and how it can be applied to solve real world problems


# Goals
- Learn about what AI is
- Learn how to apply AI to more effectively solve problems
- Build a beginner AI project
- Gain foundational understanding of the difference between machine learning, natural language processing, data analytics


# Process
I began a new project the same way that I usually do, with a google search. The first few minutes were incredibly confusing, as the internet kindly informed me that AI was not a singular topic to explore, but it is an evolving teechnology adapted through training data, and by training that data, a programmer could teach it to do essentially anything.

As a result of this discovery, I decided to document a variety of mini projects that I will be undertaking in order to gain a more complete view of what AI was capable of, and how I could utilize it in projects, or to better my day.


More to come later. For now, here is a list of references that I have used or am currently in the process of using in order to better facilitate my learning. I will continute to update this repository as I make progress
