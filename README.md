# AI-Learning
This repository is my personal active research effort to learn more about AI, and how it can be applied to solve real world problems


# Goals
- Learn about what AI is
- Learn how to apply AI to more effectively solve problems
- Build a beginner AI project
- Gain foundational understanding of the difference between machine learning, natural language processing, data analytics


# Process
I began a new project the same way that I usually do, with a google search. The first few minutes were incredibly confusing, as the internet kindly informed me that AI was not a singular topic to explore, but it is an evolving teechnology adapted through training data, and by training that data, a programmer could utilize AI to perform any number of tasks.

Therfore, I decided to document a variety of smaller projecs to gain better understanding of the variety of tasks that AI was capable of.

I began my process by skimming through Tina Huang's [Unique portfolio projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTYL-lFM22k&t=202s) video located on YouTube. The AI Tutor prompt was simple and effective for a beginner to get started, and the additional ways to improve the project created natural stopping points for someone to return to. Following her guidelines, I was very quickly able to create my own Tutor prompt, but left the project in this state after running into issues with my code editor.
Following the same video, I was super intrigued to create my own recipe developer AI. Here, I once again ran into the same issue with my work, being unable to compile Python effectively in IntelliJ. After some research, I added VS Code, and PyCharm to my laptop but ultimately returned to Jupyter Notebook for its simple effectiveness. I ran into several issues with openai in regards to importing the api key, wrong versions of things, and a lot of general frustration. In the end, I had to settle for understanding the code rather than having it run perfectly. (As a result of that, I have yet to upload that file to this repository, but I will after some editing)

Next, I followed along with Khanran's [AI in 15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1PGJ9quPV8) video posted on YouTube. The video was a very comprehensive guide of how to utilize AI to analyze large data sets. It taught me that AI was not only a progam able to generate messages based on a prompt, but it encompasses the ability to automate tasks that would take a regular person several hours. Artificial Intelligence is not only the replication of human intelligence, but it is a way to support human development and evolution by taking on the burden of arduous tasks.


More to come later. For now, a list of the resources that I have utilized to facilitate my learning will be linked below. I will continue adding to this repository as I make progress! : )

# Learning
- Utilizing Jupyter Notebook execute code within cells
- Developing a greater passion for machine learning

# Future Goals
Building an AI project reflecting correlation between the fashion industry, and global climate change.

Returning to this learning project and fullying fleshing out each of the projects to maximize their efficency.
